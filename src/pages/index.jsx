    <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Alex. Thanks for stopping by!</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently working for HMB as a software consultant. At this time, I
      am at Mercer as a member of the Software Security Group. I develop
      solutions to common problems in my spare time to help automate daily tasks
      and fill in gaps that I find in applications.
